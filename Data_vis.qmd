# Data Visualisation Experience

I would consider myself more of an engineer than designer and have been focused on bringing best engineering practices to the world of data visualisation.

- Standardisation - Products are configured and aligned to a engineering guide. This allows developers to jump between products without issue.
- Version control - Use of GitHub to manage visualisaton products
- Abstraction - Data sources and dashboards are configured and managed seperately rather than bundled together. This allows for reuse across products.

## Tableau
I have been using Tableau for over 5 years across multiple teams and currently lead dashboard development in may team.

I have completed the following Tableau delivered courses:

- Desktop I: Fundamentals
- Desktop II: Intermediate Concepts
- Visual Analytics


## Power BI
I have limited Power BI experience (lack of use in my organisation) but have completed the Microsoft delivered course and attained the Microsoft Certified: Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification as well as some personal PoC projects.
