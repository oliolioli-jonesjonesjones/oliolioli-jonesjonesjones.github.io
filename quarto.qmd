### Quarto 

This 'online CV' has been created using Quarto - a python package I have been exploring recently to create dashboard summaries.

Quarto allows you to create dynamic markdown (amongst other things) that I have been using to provide KPI summaries for senior stakeholders.

At work I create Quarto documents that use the same data source as my dashboards but output to Word/PDF/Powerpoint. My stakeholders then have a 1 page summary of key dashboard stats that can be referenced in meetings etc without having to dig through a dashboard.

Using guidance published here:
https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html


#### Steps to recreate this site:

(@) Clone this repo to begin or create your first page as index.qmd
(@) Using the quarto CLi, render the html from the .qmd file using: **quarto render** and output to a docs folder
(@) Push to your own repo
(@) In repo settings, go to Pages and select your docs folder as the source
