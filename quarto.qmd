### Quarto 

This 'online CV' has been created using Quarto - a python package I have been exploring recently to create dashboard summaries.

Quarto allows you to create dynamic markdown (amongst other things) that I have been using to provide KPI summaries for senior stakeholders.

At work I create Quarto documents that use the same data source as my dashboards but output to Word/PDF. My stakeholders then have a 1 page summary of key dashboard stats that can be referenced in meetings etc without having to dig through a dashboard.

Using guidance published here:
